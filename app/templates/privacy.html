</ul>

<p>No name, email address, student ID, home address or contact details are stored.</p>

<h3>Where is the data stored?</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Data is stored in a local SQLite database file under the ELORA project folder.</li>
    <li>The prototype does not send records to any remote server or cloud service.</li>
</ul>

<h3>How can the user control their data?</h3>
